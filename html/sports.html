          <h3>An Emotional Senior Year of Soccer</h3>
          <p class="date">September 20, 2020</p>
        </div>
        <article class="entry">This past year I was shocked to be able to have my senior season of soccer with the Pandemic still going on. Although it was the shortest season I have every played in, it defenitely lifted my spirits and gave me something to look forward to when I was struggling with online school. As much as I didn't always love playing soccer, I enjoyed the social aspect that brought together my team and allowed me to meet new people. I even got to have a Senior Night complete with posters and a picture with my family which is something I wouldn't have expected at all.  </article>

          <h3> A Short Season Comes to a Close </h3>
          <p class="date"> October 30, 2020 </p>
        </div>
        <article class="entry"> When the 10 game season came to an end I was hit with a mix of emotions. The season ended with a four game playoff round-robin, which was nothing like what playoffs had been like in the past. By the very last game, cases were spiking and I had to play wearing a medical mask, which was different than how every other game had been played. I was relieved to have a break and get to spend some time going back to the gym and having more free time, but it was also sad. Unlike lacrosse which I hadn't had a season for, I had been able to have one last Soccer season which makes all the difference to me. This picture wearing a mask during my last game is representative of how unique the 2020 soccer season was compared to any other year. </article>
